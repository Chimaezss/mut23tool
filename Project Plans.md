To start: tools in the command line
1) snipe tool
    enter card price
    take 10% of card price
2) "Lazy Buy" tool
    enter price of overall range
    tool suggests price to buy at
    report amount of sales

Next steps: 
1) set completion tool
    enter cards from set (possible find set?)
    get market value of total set
    check market value of card

2/19 - Snipe Tool has little functionality, realized that there isn't much to that. The "Lazy Buy" tool is where I want to shift a majority of my focus.
The goal is to have this done by madden 24 for a possible comeback. Maybe a snipe tool for MLB The Show would be more useful?
