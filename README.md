A project based on the current version of Madden which is 23. A tool to help make coins on the auction house. For now, features the lazy buy tool, where you search the auction for a specific overall range with no extra filters. From there, filter down to find cards that are less than that and post for that unfiltered price. It is a slow but consistent way of making coins. The goal with this project is to automate having to calculate moving the price while still maintaining a profit.
